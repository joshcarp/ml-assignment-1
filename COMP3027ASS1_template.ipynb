    "<b>Due date</b>: Friday, 8 April 2022 7pm\n",

    "<b>Submission method</b>: Canvas submission\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Submission materials</b>: This iPython notebook is a template which you will use for your Assignment 1 submission. You need to only submitted the completed copy of this iPython notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Late submissions</b>: -10% per day up to 5 days (both weekdays and weekends count). Submissions more than 5 days late will not be accepted (resul in a mark of 0).\n",

    "<b>Extensions</b>: Students who are demonstrably unable to submit a full solution in time due to medical reasons or other trauma, may apply for an extension.  In these cases, you should email <a href=\"mailto:ni.ding@unimelb.edu.au\">Ni Ding</a> as soon as possible after those circumstances arise. If you attend a GP or other health care service as a result of illness, be sure to provide a Health Professional Report (HPR) form (get it from the Special Consideration section of the Student Portal), you will need this form to be filled out if your illness develops into something that later requires a Special Consideration application to be lodged. You should scan the HPR form and send it with the extension requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Marks</b>: This assignment will be marked out of 20, and make up 20% of your overall mark for this subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Materials</b>: Use Jupyter Notebook and Python page on Canvas for information on the basic setup required for this class, including an iPython notebook viewer and the python packages NLTK, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn. You can use any Python built-in packages, but do not use any other 3rd party packages; if your iPython notebook doesn't run on the marker's machine, you will lose marks. <b> You should use Python 3</b>.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Evaluation</b>: Your iPython notebook should run end-to-end without any errors in a reasonable amount of time, and you must follow all instructions provided below, including specific implementation requirements and instructions for what needs to be printed (please avoid printing output we don't ask for). You should edit the sections below where requested, but leave the rest of the code as is. You should leave the output from running your code in the iPython notebook you submit, to assist with marking. The amount each section is worth is given in parenthesis after the instructions. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will be marked not only on the correctness of your methods, but also the quality and efficency of your code: in particular, you should be careful to use Python built-in functions and operators when appropriate and pick descriptive variable names that adhere to <a href=\"https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/\">Python style requirements</a>. If you think it might be unclear what you are doing, you should comment your code to help the marker make sense of it. We reserve the right to deduct up to 2 marks for unreadable or exessively inefficient code.\n",
    "\n",
    "8 of the marks available for this Project will be assigned to whether the four specified Python functions work in a manner consistent with the materials from COMP30027. Any other implementation will not be directly assessed (except insofar as it is required to make these five functions work correctly).\n",
    "\n",
    "12 of the marks will be assigned to your responses to the questions, in terms of both accuracy and insightfulness. We will be looking for evidence that you have an implementation that allows you to explore the problem, but also that you have thought deeply about the data and the behaviour of the Naive Bayes classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Updates</b>: Any major changes to the assignment will be announced via Canvas. Minor changes and clarifications will be announced on the discussion board (ED -> Assignments -> A1); we recommend you check it regularly.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Academic misconduct</b>: For most people, collaboration will form a natural part of the undertaking of this homework, and we encourge you to discuss it in general terms with other students. However, this ultimately is still an individual task, and so reuse of code or other instances of clear influence will be considered cheating. Please check the <a href=\"https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/124196/modules#module_662096\">CIS Academic Honesty training</a> for more information.

    "Instructions\n",
    "1. Do **not** shuffle the data set\n",
    "2. Treat the attributes as they are(e.g., do **not** convert numeric attributes to categorical or categorical to numeric). Implement a Naive Bayes classifier with appropriate likelihood function for each attribute.\n",
    "3. You should implement the Naive Bayes classifier from scratch. Do **not** use existing implementations/learning algorithms.\n",
    "4. You CANNOT have more than one train or predict function. Both continuous numeric attributes and categorical ones should be trained in one `train()` function, similarly for the `predict()`.  \n",
    "5. Apart from the instructions in point 3, you may use libraries to help you with data reading, representation, maths or evaluation\n",
    "6. Ensure that all and only required information is printed, as indicated in the final three code cells. Failure to adhere to print the required information will result in **[-1 mark]** per case. *(We don't mind details like you print a list or several numbers -- just make sure the information is displayed so that it's easily accessible)\n",
    "7. You may change the prototypes of these functions, and you may write other functions, according to your requirements. We would appreciate it if the required functions were prominent/easy to find. \n",
    "8. You should add adequate comments to make your code easily comprehendible.*"
